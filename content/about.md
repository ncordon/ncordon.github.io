I am a software engineer, based in London, UK.

I am currently developing Neo4j's [language server](https://github.com/neo4j/cypher-language-support/), in Typescript. The project includes some sophisticated parts such as a part of the database's stack transpiled from Java / Scala to Javascript, which provides for semantic analysis of queries. Previous to that, I was working on the surface of their query execution engine. Before that, I worked at Disney Streaming, developing microservices in functional Scala.

Overall I've worked with a great range of projects and languages: ranging from research in machine learning, genomics, compiler stacks, distributed systems to now language projects. I like to have a deep understanding of things, hard problems and continuous learning motivate me, I like to work at a high pace and I am very adaptable.
