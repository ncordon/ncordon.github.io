I am Spanish software engineer, based at London, UK.

I studied a Bachelor's degree on Computer Science and Mathematics at university of Granada, Spain. And a Master's degree on Mathematics and Physics, at the same university.

I currently work with Scala, developing microservices. I have also worked or done personal projects with Go, R or Python. I am a computer enthusiast and fan of difficult problems.
